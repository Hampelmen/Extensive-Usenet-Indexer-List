# Extensive-Usenet-Indexer-Table
Extensive Usenet Indexer Table with registration status, membership types, API hits, download hits, membership duration, membership prices and payment methods. <br><br>
(The tables may not be fully visible because of the amount of columns.<br>
By clicking on a table you will be able to move the table left and right by using the arrow keys <kbd>←</kbd>, <kbd>→</kbd>.)

## Table of content: <br>
[Moderated Indexers](#moderated-indexers) <br>
[Public Indexers](#public-indexers) <br>
[Spotweb Indexers](#spotweb-indexers) <br>

## Moderated Indexers <br>
Best kind of indexer. They offer API access, which makes automation with tools like Sonarr, and Radarr possible and NZBs can be directly sent to your download manager. They index obfuscated NZBs with release names and passwords.

## Public Indexers <br>
They index automatically from Usenet groups. They only have mostly obfuscated headers and the NZBs never come with a password. <br>
